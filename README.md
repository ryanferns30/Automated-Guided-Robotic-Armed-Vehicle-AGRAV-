# Automated-Guided-Robotic-Armed-Vehicle-AGRAV-
AGRAV (Automated Guided Robotic Armed Vehicle) integrates a 6-DOF robotic arm with an AGV to automate material handling and pick-and-place tasks. Built as a capstone prototype, it combines mobility and manipulation using Arduino control, mecanum wheels, line following, obstacle avoidance, and Bluetooth control via a custom Android app.
